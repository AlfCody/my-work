    <H2>Experience</H2>
    <p> I have worked on many projects and research paper during my studies</p>
    <li><b> Secure Pass : </b>
    <i> A password mangaing system made using C# and Ms SQL server. in which you have create a account, then save ur password, and also can help in genrate password</i></li>
    <li><b> IRSD 2023 Research paper:</b> <i> A Comparative Study and Analysis of MOOC Platforms 
    </i></li>
    <li><b> Automated Room Air and Temperature Monitoring System</b><i> During my last semester, I attended a workshop at IIT Delhi where an air monitoring device was showcased. Inspired by this, I developed an IoT system using an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor temperature, humidity, and air quality. The system controls home devices like fans and ACs to balance the room environment, displays real-time data on an LCD, and features a web interface for remote control. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with IoT development, microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and creating user interfaces for web platforms.</i></li>
